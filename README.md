# DSA-Journey
My DSA learning journey using C++ — tracking problems, concepts, and growth.

# 🚀 Striver A‑to‑Z DSA Journey

This repository contains all my C++ code and notes while following [Striver’s A‑to‑Z DSA Course/Sheet]([https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-dsa-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)). It's a part of my **pre-college roadmap** to master Data Structures & Algorithms step-by-step.

## 📚 What I'm Doing

- ✅ Following Striver’s YouTube A2Z course + DSA Sheet
- ✅ Writing clean and commented code in C++
- ✅ Creating handwritten notes for each concept
- ✅ Uploading progress here for accountability
- ✅ Staying consistent to gain early momentum in college

## 🧠 Notes

I also create handwritten notes alongside each section (dry runs, edge cases, patterns, formulas, time and space complexity). I plan to upload them later in PDF format under a `/Notes` folder for revision use.

## ⚙️ How to Run Code

```bash
# Navigate into the folder
cd 03_Sorting

# Compile the file
g++ -std=c++17 01_bubble_sort.cpp -o bubble

# Run the executable
./bubble
